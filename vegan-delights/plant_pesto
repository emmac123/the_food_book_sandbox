Take a big handful of any leafy green veges (parsely, coriander, spinach, basil, dandelion, even steamed brocolli) and put them in the food processor.
Add a handful of nuts (cashews are fine, walnuts or peacan yummy and pinenuts supreme), oil and apple cider vinegar, and salt.
Blend.

#### Enjoy !!
